        <h2><u>Research Overview</u></h2>
        <p>The United States Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA, is responsible for not only overseeing the regulation of food, drink, and cosmetic products, but also the regulation of medical devices. While the FDA does try its hardest to ensure all products that enter the market are completely safe for use, unfortunately it is simply impossible to catch everything and some defective or faulty equipment does find its way into the consumer market. 	One of the largest and most recent medical device recalls was the 2021 recall involving Philips Respironics and some of their CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure), and ventilator machines. The recalls, issued both by the FDA and Philips Respironics, were due to hazardous particles and chemical emissions caused by the type of foam used in the machines, and affected millions of people within, and outside of, the United States. Situations like this are absolutely horrible, and current legislation surrounding the approval process a medical device must go through before entering the market only make recalls like this all the more likely to occur in the future. The FDA categorizes devices into three different classes based on the potential risk they could pose to patient safety: Class I has the lowest risk, Class II has a moderate risk, and Class III has the highest risk. (The FDA also has three categories for recalls which are conversely ranked having Class I recalls being the ones that pose the most risk to patient health, Class II being intermediary, and Class III posing the least amount of risk.)
