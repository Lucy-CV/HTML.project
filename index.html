        <h2><u>Research Overview</u></h2>
        <p>The United States Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA, is responsible for not only overseeing the regulation of food, drink, and cosmetic products, but also the regulation of medical devices. While the FDA does try its hardest to ensure all products that enter the market are completely safe for use, unfortunately it is simply impossible to catch everything and some defective or faulty equipment does find its way into the consumer market. 	One of the largest and most recent medical device recalls was the 2021 recall involving Philips Respironics and some of their CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure), and ventilator machines. The recalls, issued both by the FDA and Philips Respironics, were due to hazardous particles and chemical emissions caused by the type of foam used in the machines, and affected millions of people within, and outside of, the United States. Situations like this are absolutely horrible, and current legislation surrounding the approval process a medical device must go through before entering the market only make recalls like this all the more likely to occur in the future. The FDA categorizes devices into three different classes based on the potential risk they could pose to patient safety: Class I has the lowest risk, Class II has a moderate risk, and Class III has the highest risk. (The FDA also has three categories for recalls which are conversely ranked having Class I recalls being the ones that pose the most risk to patient health, Class II being intermediary, and Class III posing the least amount of risk.) Based on these classifications, the device will be approved for market in one of three different ways. The highest risk devices will be approved through a process known as premarket approval (PMA), in which “proof of being ‘reasonably safe and effective’ based on one premarket clinical trial and premarket inspection of manufacturing facility” is required. Moderate risk devices will be approved through the 510(k) process, where they must show that they are “‘substantially equivalent’ to a device already on the market that was also subject to 510(k) review,” but do not have to prove their effectiveness or safety. Finally, the lowest risk devices can be exempt from regulatory review and do not have to submit any materials or evidence. This is beyond shocking, and policies like these create a system that is vulnerable to grossly over relying on recalls (and their subsequent actions) to “protect” its consumers/patients when really the focus should be on regulatory steps taken before a device is allowed onto the market. Considering medical devices influence something as serious as a person’s health, premarket approval should be the standard form of regulatory review for all of them. Additionally, a study published in the National Library of Medicine looked at 28,556 medical devices, and found that of the devices that had been recalled, an astonishing 97% of them were approved via 510(k) review. That being said, it does not mean that if all medical devices were to be approved via PMA, there would no longer be any issues or recalls. In fact, of the 28,556 devices observed, 310 were cleared by PMA and of those 310, 84 of them were recalled. That is over 27% of PMA approved devices being recalled. At this point, it really seems as though there needs to be some major policy changes or updates in the FDA’s medical device approval process. Too many unsafe or inadequate products are being released, too many recalls are being issued, and the health of too many people is being jeopardized. </p>
